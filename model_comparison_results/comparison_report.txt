## Key Findings

1. **Overall Performance**: The fine-tuned model shows significant improvement compared to the baseline.

2. **Summary Quality**: Fine-tuned model generates more coherent summaries.

3. **Length Appropriateness**: Normal model shows better length matching.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis:
- Deploy fine-tuned model for production use
- Inference performance is acceptable
